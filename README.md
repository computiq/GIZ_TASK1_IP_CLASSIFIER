GIZ Task 1 - IP address classifier Solution

* It is my week 0 task solution that is given by Computiq company for their Full-Stack Development Bootcamp.
* The task purpose is to build a command line tool that receives an IP address in the format: x.x.x.x/x, and print the class of the IP address
* I used this Repo as a reference 
[https://github.com/laith43d/ipcalculator-LZ-](https://github.com/laith43d/ipcalculator-LZ-)
* There is an error with (ip) definition I think it is because of the indentation :(
